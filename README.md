MaltegoTransforms
=================

Basic Maltego Transforms

For the stopwords:
1. sudo pip install nltk
2. Run the Python CLI
3. import nltk
4. nltk.download()

You'll need Twitter API keys for the twitter transforms (duh). dev.twitter.com

For probing stuff you need:
1. a monitoring interface preferably with injection drives (airmon-ng start wlan0)
2. A mysql db with a probes table with MAC, SSID and time tables
3. patience

There may be bugs.
